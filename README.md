## What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a gathering of programmers aimed at collaboratively addressing a challenge or technical problem faced by an organization in record time through their collaborative work. This response typically takes the form of a finished prototype for an innovative product, service, or business model.

We use this event to reward those programmers who first achieve certain objectives. Depending on the difficulty, the prize varies in each case.
